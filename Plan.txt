We need:
1) A class that handles the data:
	a) Reads the data file
	b) Counts the words and labels
	c) Writes the words and labels according to their frequency to a file.
	d) Calculates the probabilities for the taggers (e(xi|yi), q(yi_yi-1, yi-2).
2) Base class for tagger:
	a) Has attributes for e prob and q probs
	b) Gets a text, iterates over it and tags each word.
3) A child class of tagger for greedy Tagger
	a) Tags by the greedy algorithm
4) A child class of tagger for Viterbi Algorithm
	b) Tag by the viterbi algorithm

Need to calculate:
1) e(xi|yi)
	a) count(xi, yi)
	b) count(yi)
2) q(yi|yi-1, yi-2)
	a) p(yi, yi-1, yi-2)
	b) p(yi-1, yi-2)



TODO:
1) Add Methods to data manager that returns e(xi_yi), q(yi|yi-1, yi-2)
2) Add greedy tagger class.
3) add viterbi tagger class.
